# NaraeAsynchronous
NaraeAsynchronous is Easy-Make Main/Background threading and optimized multi-threading working such as getting image from variable request.

I made this library cause AsyncTask's poolsize is too small in various environment, this can be make lack of my application.

## Meaning
NaraeAsynchronous is compound word between "나래"(Narae) which means "Wing" in traditional korean word and Asynchronous.

Now, I'll give you wings on your Thread!

## Features

### Generate Main Thread 

**cannot be use as a UI Thread, use runOnUIThread instead.**

````
NaraeMain naraeMain = new NaraeMain(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
         // TODO: Do something!
    }
});
naraeMain.execute();
````

Do you want simple-code?

````
new NaraeMain(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
         // TODO: Do something!
    }
}).execute();
````

NaraeMain class has one methods, ````execute()````.

### Generate Background Thread

````
NaraeAsync naraeAsync = new NaraeAsync(new Runnable() {
   @Override
   public void run() {
       // TODO: Do something!
   } 
});
naraeAsync.execute();
````

Do you want simple-code?

````
new NaraeAsync(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        //TODO: Do something!
    }
}).execute();
````

This features has Compatibility code of AsyncTask.

````
new NaraeAsync(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        //TODO: Do something!
    }
}).executeOnExecutor();
````

#### Constructor
* Runnable ````runnable```` : Compulsory Object, Runnable object to run
* int ````poolSize```` : Optional Object, Pool size to execute multi-threading. Default value provided.
  * Basic Mode: Core Count + 1;
  * AsyncTask compatibility mode: Available Core Count + 1;
* String ````taskType```` : Optional Object, Task type. Default value provided.

### Combining Background threading + Main threading
This features provide you to execute background thread and execute main thread after executing background thread.

````
NaraeTask naraeTask = new NaraeTask(new NaraeInterface() {
    @Override
    public Object doInBackground() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void onPostExecute(Object o) {

    }
});
naraeTask.execute();
````

also, you can use simple-code.

````
 new NaraeTask(new NaraeInterface() {
    @Override
    public Object doInBackground() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void onPostExecute(Object o) {

    }
}).execute();
````

also, you can give specific return type.

````
new NaraeTask(new NaraeInterface<String>() {
    @Override
    public String doInBackground() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public void onPostExecute(String s) {

    }
}).execute();
````

#### Constructor
* Runnable ````runnable```` : Compulsory Object, Runnable object to run
* int ````poolSize```` : Optional Object, Pool size to execute multi-threading. Default value provided.
  * Basic Mode: Core Count + 1;
  * AsyncTask compatibility mode: Available Core Count + 1;
